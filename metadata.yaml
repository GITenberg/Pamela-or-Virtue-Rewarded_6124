description: For a fascinating glimpse into eighteenth-century morals and values,
  take a look at Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded. A blockbuster of
  a bestseller in its day, Pamela recounts the tribulations of a poor housekeeper
  who is forced constantly to fend off the prurient advances of her employer. Her
  reward? Pamela is offered -- and accepts -- her lustful master's hand in marriage
  and is thrust into upper-class society.
